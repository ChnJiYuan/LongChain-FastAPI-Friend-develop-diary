# 2025.12.4 Development Log (LangChain + FastAPI Chat Companion)

## 1. Project Creation

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
```

Then in the terminal:

```bash
npx create-vite my-app --template react-ts
```

Prompt: `? Use rolldown-vite (Experimental)?`
- Yes
- No

### What is Rolldown Vite?

**Rolldown** is a next-generation bundler developed by the Vite team (led by Evan You) to replace Rollup and esbuild currently used by Vite.

**Key advantages:**

- **Written in Rust** – Significantly faster than JavaScript implementations
- **Rollup plugin compatible** – Seamless ecosystem integration (long-term goal)
- **Experimental stage** – Functional but incomplete features and potential bugs

## 2. Impact of Choosing Rolldown

### Choose Yes (Rolldown)

**Best for:** Advanced users, early adopters, performance-focused projects

**Benefits:**
- Faster HMR (hot module replacement)
- Faster build speeds
- Early adaptation to future Vite defaults

**Risks:**
- ⚠ Incomplete plugin compatibility
- ⚠ Potential bugs (experimental status)
- ⚠ Limited documentation and community support

### Choose No (Traditional Rollup)

**Best for:** Production projects, stability-critical applications

**Benefits:**
- Mature, stable solution
- Full plugin compatibility
- Extensive community resources
- No unexpected build issues

**Future:** Vite will migrate automatically when Rolldown stabilizes.
